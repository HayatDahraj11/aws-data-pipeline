# Clickstream Data Pipeline Implementation

## Description
This project implements a sophisticated data pipeline for processing and analyzing clickstream data from a caf√© website using Apache logs and AWS CloudWatch. The system captures detailed visitor interactions, converts them into structured JSON format, and leverages AWS CloudWatch for comprehensive log collection, storage, and analytics. The implementation includes geolocation data integration and interactive visualizations for enhanced business intelligence.

## Key Features
- Apache web server log transformation from CLF to JSON format
- Real-time log monitoring and analysis
- Geolocation data integration for visitor tracking
- AWS CloudWatch integration for centralized logging
- Interactive visualizations for business metrics
- Long-term data storage solution using S3
- Customized dashboards for business insights

## Technical Architecture
- **Web Server**: Apache with modified logging configuration
- **Log Processing**: Custom JSON formatting
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS CloudWatch Agent
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for long-term retention
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch Dashboards and Insights
- **Data Format**: Structured JSON with geolocation enrichment

## Installation and Setup
1. Configure Apache Web Server:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/www/access
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/www/error
```

2. Install CloudWatch Agent:
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

3. Configure CloudWatch Settings:
```bash
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-200-
sudo mv config.json /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/
```

## Configuration
The system includes two main log groups:
- apache/access: For tracking visitor interactions
- apache/error: For monitoring system issues
Both groups are configured with a 180-day retention policy.

## Data Visualization
The implementation includes several pre-configured visualizations:
- Menu view distribution by city
- Purchase patterns by region
- Visitor geolocation analysis
- Traffic trends over time

## What I Learned
- Advanced Apache log configuration and customization
- AWS CloudWatch configuration and management
- Real-time log processing techniques
- Integration of geolocation data with web logs
- Data visualization best practices in CloudWatch
- JSON data structure optimization for analytics
- Cloud-based log management strategies
- Infrastructure as Code principles
- Performance monitoring and alerting setup
- AWS S3 lifecycle management

## Usage Examples
Monitor logs in real-time:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/www/access/access_log
```

Create a visualization query:
```sql
fields remoteIP, city
| filter request = "/cafe/menu.php"
| stats count() as menupopular by city
| sort menupopular desc
| limit 10
```

## Maintenance
- Regular monitoring of CloudWatch log groups
- Periodic review of retention policies
- Backup verification for S3 stored logs
- Dashboard and visualization updates as needed

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning integration for pattern detection
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Real-time alerting system
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Mobile dashboard support
